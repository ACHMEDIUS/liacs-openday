# LIACS Open Day Portal

> Interactive Next.js 15 portal for Leiden University's LIACS Open Day, featuring hands-on demos, question workflows, and Firebase-backed admin tooling.

Important notes:
- Built with the App Router (`app/`) and TypeScript-first components under `components/`; styling relies on Tailwind CSS utilities and shadcn/ui primitives.
- Client data flows through Firebase (client SDK in `lib/firebase.ts`) with Cloud Functions in `functions/src`; translations live in `lib/i18n/`.
- Vitest and Testing Library power unit coverage (`test/`), and npm scripts in `package.json` orchestrate build, lint, and analyze tasks.
- Public assets ship from `public/` and `data/questions.ts`; ensure updates mirror kiosk/demo content before deployment.
